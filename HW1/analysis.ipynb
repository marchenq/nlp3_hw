There were some things they failed to explain, that we collectively came up with our own answer for. Other than that, it was great. I never felt bored or left waiting for more. Overall, I feel it was very well written, produced and acted. Well worth the watching. Some people on here have griped that it was 'predictable', but then, most movies are. Who ever watched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win??? Who ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to save the day?

The editing, score and integration of CGI is outstanding. This film is put together beautifully. Although The Martian isn't just exceptional on the technical side, it's also insanely entertaining. And that is thanks to the excellent script and line delivery by Matt Damon. This is his best performance in years. He's everything from witty to emotionally fragile, which forms such a complex and compelling character. The Martian has a perfect balance of distress and great humour. I love the integration of music by David Bowie and ABBA. It really helps lift up the spirit. The large cast doesn't weigh down the film at all, as they all add something more to the story.

At some point I thought I was watching the A-team show. They use a home-made bomb to de-accelerate the spacecraft?

I understand movies are not making money due to many factors but this movie is rated way to high . I understand people are more vested in movie series like true blood ,game of thrones , etc where u get emotionally attached to characters but every movie should have highs and lows and with this star cast there was no feel for any of the characters .

    "Точность предсказания 78,15%, что кажется довольно неплохим результатом. Улучшить программу можно следующими способами: учитывать частотность слов, а не только факт их наличия в том или ином множестве. Это позволит исключить неоднозначность в случае, когда число \"хороших\" и \"плохих\" слов одинаково, и отдать предпочтение слову, имеющему большую значимость. Также думаю, что увеличить точность оценки могло бы сравнение не просто слов по отдельности, но целых составляющих. Ещё одним улучшением может послужить не удаление пунктуации, как мы это делали здесь, а наоборот её анализ. На это обращается внимание во многих исследованиях по сентиментному анализу, например в [Parlar, Özel, Song 2019: 124]: «In the topical classification of text, stemming as well as the removal of stop words and punctuation marks are usually applied to reduce the feature size and improve the classification accuracy. However, punctuation marks and stop words may be important in sentiment analysis, as they can be used to express sentiments.»."
